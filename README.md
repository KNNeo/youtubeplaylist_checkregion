#### Simple Python 3 code to check region availability on YouTube playlist  for all videos

#### Does not come with executable, requires YouTube API v3 key edit on file (register at cloud.google.com)

###### Program flow: .py program asks for playlist URL, checks every video for allowed or blocked region codes. Prints result so long as query to API includes more than one allowed/blocked region

###### Improvements: neater printout, export to file, obtain list of active YouTube regions and compare to show only blocked regions
